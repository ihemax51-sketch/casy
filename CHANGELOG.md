- Rebuilt the CASY web interface around a comfortable task-first workspace with readable typography, restrained light surfaces, grouped navigation, and consistent controls across desktop, tablet, and mobile.
- Replaced the long sidebar and decorative top-bar controls with collapsible tool groups, real tool search, clear connection status, and a focused owner menu.
- Rebuilt Live Control as one guided three-step form covering silk, self teleport, position teleport, town return, targeted notice, and disconnect through the verified KMTGuard procedures.
- Added automatic CharID or player-name targeting without exposing procedure variants, queues, or runtime implementation details to the operator.
- Simplified the account, character, inventory, skill, silk, monster, drop, fortress, and economy studios so one selected action is visible at a time with its inputs, preview, confirmation, and result.
- Refreshed login, profile, connection, dashboard, item, NPC, area, audit, and maintenance presentation and removed raw-table shortcuts from the daily Area workflow.

- Corrected ID allocation for non-identity linked item rows and full-world dependencies.
- Included reviewed `Teleport_*` procedures in Live Control discovery without changing the KMTGuard runtime contract.
- Requirement: refresh the CASY web application and rebuild frontend assets. No Filter, Client DLL, or SQL update is required.

- Requirement: refresh the CASY web application and apply its Laravel migrations. Use a least-privilege SQL login for daily operations.

## Update v6.0.0

Release date: 2026-08-27

- Corrected Auto Mastery and Auto Skill so they continue operating after the Skills window is closed and stop safely when the character changes or the client cannot confirm an update.
- Fixed a client crash that could occur while opening the Skills window after the automation update.
- Restored Auto Mastery and Auto Skill activation so both features continue retrying safely while game skill data is still loading.
- Improved Auto Mastery and Auto Skill response timing while keeping their safe retry and server-protection behavior unchanged.
- Requirement for this Client correction: replace the Client DLL and client media/resources, then restart the game client. No SQL, Filter, or GameServer update is required.

- Rebuilt protected-region admission so character, Job, race, level, party, and travel-method requirements are checked before Teleport, Reverse, Trace, and managed server travel begins.
- Replaced the region-specific bot timer with an optional inactivity return. Each region can disable the feature or return characters to town after its configured number of seconds without movement.
- Hardened custom Reverse travel so the GameServer requires an authenticated admission approval before consuming the scroll or beginning world movement.
- Corrected the protected-region SQL update so newly added admission columns are available before existing rows are normalized on SQL Server.
- Corrected destination verification for normal and custom NPC teleport gates so valid travel is no longer denied before region admission checks run.
- Corrected signed Region IDs so protected regions with negative IDs are recognized consistently across Teleport, Reverse, Trace, managed travel, and arrival verification.
- Corrected Last Man Standing combat validation so players inside the configured event arena can target and attack each other correctly.
- Requirement for this LMS correction: replace the GameServer add-on and restart the GameServer. No SQL, Filter, Client DLL, or media update is required.
- Corrected Defend The Tower generation so both configured towers are queued through the existing `NPC_SpawnAtPosition` database procedure using the event's configured World ID, Region ID, and coordinates.
- Requirement for this Defend The Tower correction: replace the Filter and restart it. No SQL, GameServer, ShardManager, Client DLL, or media update is required.
- Restored GameServer monster generation for database spawn commands, including spawn by position, spawn by code name, and spawn near a player, so event towers and event monsters are no longer discarded before native creation.
- Requirement for this monster generation correction: replace the GameServer add-on and restart the GameServer. No SQL, Filter, ShardManager, Client DLL, or media update is required.
- Removed the recurring GameServer command bridge health line from the ShardManager console while retaining startup, recovery, and genuine failure diagnostics.
- Requirement for this console cleanup: replace the ShardManager add-on and restart the ShardManager. No SQL, Filter, GameServer, Client DLL, or media update is required.
- Closed the short Reverse guide-packet path that could begin travel before protected-region requirements were checked; malformed or unsupported travel selectors are now rejected before reaching the GameServer.
- Added a first-stage Reverse scroll activation check so saved recall and death destinations are evaluated before the scroll can enter native GameServer travel state, including paths that omit the later destination request.
- Corrected inactivity and denied-arrival recovery so characters are returned to their actual town recall point instead of being reloaded at the same coordinates.
- Simplified Region Control into clear Build, Job, race, party, travel, and inactivity choices; removed the retired bot policy and conflicting duplicate settings while preserving existing rules during the SQL conversion.
- Rebuilt the Admin Desktop Region Control page around the simplified table, including signed Region ID support and readable rule summaries.
- Added a GameServer-authoritative item/region travel guard: the server now records the real inventory Item ID at use time and rejects matching world movement before it starts. The same rule also prevents that item from being used while the character is already inside the configured region.
- Simplified item/region rules to World ID, Region ID, Item ID, Enabled, and Note. Rules are loaded once at GameServer startup, so changing them requires a GameServer restart and adds no recurring database load.
- Requirement for a fresh v6.0.0 installation: apply the included SQL update, replace the Filter, Admin Desktop, and GameServer add-on, then restart the Filter and GameServer.
- Requirement for this corrective refresh: apply the included v6.0.0 SQL update first, replace the Filter and GameServer add-on, then restart both services. No Client DLL or media update is required.

Release date: 2026-08-17

- Fixed an issue where players could bypass region restrictions by using a standard Reverse Return Scroll from a safe area to teleport into a restricted area. The Filter now intercepts and blocks the actual teleport request if the destination region is restricted.

- Prevented characters from registering for or teleporting into events (Survival Solo, Survival Party, Madness, Defend Tower, Last Man Standing) while wearing a Job suit.
- Players wearing a Job suit will now receive a warning message and must remove their suit to participate.

- Added a new Hook_SpawnComplete stored procedure that runs after a character has fully entered the game world, providing CharID, CharName, RegionID, WorldID, JobType, InParty, and FirstSpawn parameters for custom post-spawn logic such as welcome messages, VIP buffs, or tracking.
- FirstSpawn indicates whether the character has just logged in for the first time in this session; teleports and region changes do not re-trigger the hook.
- The hook runs in the background and does not block or delay the normal spawn process.
- Requirement: run the SQL update, replace the Filter files, and restart the Filter. No Client DLL, media, GameServer, or ShardManager update is required.

Release date: 2026-08-17

- Removed high-frequency Clientless hunting telemetry from database persistence and routine logs, preventing combat activity from saturating the background database queue or producing oversized log files.
- Clientless connection, online, disconnection, and genuine failure diagnostics remain available; hunting and connection behavior are unchanged.
- Prevented the new Job experience bar from closing the client when a character receives negative, incomplete, or otherwise invalid Job experience data.
- Monster Drops now load both grouped/random and direct monster item drops through the new database procedure used by the Filter. Apply the SQL update and replace the Filter files; no Client DLL or media update is required.
- Established KMTGuard 6.0.0 as the unified source baseline across the Filter, Client DLL, GameServer add-on, ShardManager add-on, launcher, licensing tools, and desktop applications.
- Preserved the complete existing source, release history, generated artifacts, media, database updates, and supporting tools in the baseline snapshot.
- Requirement: replace the Filter files and Client DLL, restart the Agent role, and fully restart the game client. No SQL, media, Admin Desktop, GameServer, or ShardManager update is required.

## Update v3.9.8

Release date: 2026-08-15

- Corrected false required-client-update disconnects when a player retried login after the Gateway had rejected a previous attempt.
- Failed Gateway login attempts now return verified players to the normal login state without repeating device verification or weakening client validation.
- Requirement: replace the Filter files and restart the Gateway role. No SQL update, Client DLL replacement, media update, Admin Desktop replacement, GameServer replacement, or ShardManager replacement is required.

## Update v3.9.7

Release date: 2026-08-15

- Fixed Reverse Scroll movement to a party member leaving the game interface in a broken loading state and disconnecting the player.
- Requirement: replace the GameServer add-on and restart the GameServer. No Filter, SQL, Client DLL, media, or ShardManager update is required.

## Update v3.9.6

Release date: 2026-08-14

- Eliminated the intermittent client startup crash seen with SBot, mBot, and other external loaders by preventing the login interface from starting before KMTGuard initialization and interface registration are complete.
- Added safe main-thread recovery for loader sequences that attach after the client's normal asset-initialization phase, so custom login interfaces cannot be created from an incomplete runtime state.
- Client startup now stops with a dedicated diagnostic if initialization genuinely fails instead of continuing into an unrelated client assertion.
- Requirement: replace the Client DLL, fully close the game and any bot or launcher processes, then start them again. No Filter, SQL, media, GameServer, or ShardManager update is required.

## Update v3.9.5

Release date: 2026-08-14

- Corrected the Clientless world-entry handoff so finishing the startup packet burst no longer cancels an active network read or closes an otherwise healthy character connection.
- Clientless characters now retain the same live socket while moving from character loading into online keepalive and combat-profile preparation.
- Restored the GameServer's complete native-compatible world-transfer handshake for authenticated Clientless hunting and town positioning, preventing characters from disappearing at their first automated relocation.
- GameServer startup now includes a reversible cleanup for item-option mappings that reference missing skills, preventing hidden blocking dialogs from leaving the shard unavailable after a restart while preserving every removed mapping in a backup table.
- Clientless Gateway rejections now retain the upstream reason code in diagnostics so account, capacity, and shard-availability failures can be distinguished without guesswork.
- Requirement: Developer/Test preview only. Replace the Developer Filter package and Developer/Test GameServer add-on, apply the v3.9.5 SQL update, then restart the Agent Filter and GameServer. No client DLL, media, or ShardManager replacement is required. CustomerProductionBase remains unchanged.

## Update v3.9.4

Release date: 2026-08-14

- Clientless characters now finish the complete initial world-spawn cycle before hunting, town parking, party automation, or custom movement begins, preventing newly connected characters from immediately disappearing and reconnecting.
- World entry now consumes the remaining startup packet burst before enabling automation instead of depending on database-loading speed or server timing.
- Socket receiving and keepalive now continue while combat profiles load, so large account batches do not disconnect when database preparation takes several seconds.
- Requirement: Developer/Test preview only. Replace the Developer Filter package and restart the Agent Filter. No SQL update, client DLL, media, GameServer, or ShardManager replacement is required. CustomerProductionBase remains unchanged.

## Update v3.9.3

Release date: 2026-08-14

- Restored the concise professional GameServer console by hiding routine per-setting old/new value lines while retaining genuine validation, patch, rollback, and startup failures.
- Kept the corrected single-owner Quest RaiseEvent diagnostic patch and all existing GameServer behavior unchanged.
- Requirement: Developer/Test preview only. Replace the Developer/Test GameServer add-on and restart the GameServer. No Filter, SQL, client DLL, media, or ShardManager update is required. CustomerProductionBase remains unchanged.

## Update v3.9.2

Release date: 2026-08-14

- Corrected the GameServer startup regression caused by applying the Quest RaiseEvent suppression from two initialization paths.
- The diagnostic is now owned by one verified startup patch that suppresses only its five-byte logging call, preserves the surrounding stack behavior, and restores the original call during rollback.
- Added a regression check that rejects duplicate ownership of the same GameServer instruction block.
- Requirement: Developer/Test preview only. Replace the Developer/Test GameServer add-on and restart the GameServer. No Filter, SQL, client DLL, media, or ShardManager update is required. CustomerProductionBase remains unchanged.

## Update v3.9.1

Release date: 2026-08-14

- Removed the repeatedly generated Quest RaiseEvent diagnostic from the GameServer hot path, reducing unnecessary logging overhead while preserving quest processing.
- Requirement: replace the GameServer add-on and restart the GameServer. No SQL update, Filter replacement, Client DLL replacement, media update, or ShardManager replacement is required.

## Update v3.9.0

Release date: 2026-08-14

- Developer/Test Create Accounts now controls Attack Pets and Grab Pets independently, allowing either pet, both pets, or no pets for each new batch.
- Attack-pet supplies are added only when an Attack Pet is selected, while Grab-only characters receive only their selected standard vSRO Grab Pet.
- Existing Clientless accounts preserve their previous combined pet preference when the independent settings are introduced, and Prepare Existing Combat respects the stored choice for each pet type.
- Requirement: Developer/Test preview only. Replace the Developer Filter package and apply the included v3.9.0 SQL update before testing new account creation. CustomerProductionBase remains on v3.8.0.

## Update v3.8.0

Release date: 2026-08-14

- Party Matching now offers two clear persistent modes: one individual Party Form per online Clientless character with no managed grouping, or real city-based parties of up to eight with one leader Party Form.
- Switching modes removes the previous managed Party Forms and party membership before applying the selected behavior, preventing characters from continuing to regroup after Individual Forms is selected.
- The Party Matching dashboard now explains both choices, applies the selected mode with one button, and enables the manual party rebuild action only for Groups of 8 mode.
- Disabling Party automation now removes managed Party Forms and leaves managed parties instead of leaving old party membership active.
- Requirement: replace the Filter package, restart the Agent Filter and Control Center, and apply the included v3.8.0 SQL update. No Client DLL replacement, media update, GameServer replacement, or ShardManager replacement is required.

## Update v3.7.0

Release date: 2026-08-14

- Bulk Clientless creation now completes mixed level ranges correctly when a low-level character has not naturally unlocked its first weapon skill yet; the character uses its normal attack until the mastery skill becomes available.
- Skill preparation still stops safely when an attack skill should be available but could not be installed, preserving the existing weapon, mastery, and combat validation.
- Create Accounts now provides independent Avatar Outfit and Attack & Grab Pets choices for each new batch, with both enabled by default to preserve existing behavior.
- Accounts created with avatars or pets disabled keep that choice when Prepare Existing Combat is used, while all existing accounts retain their current enabled behavior.
- Requirement: replace the Filter package and restart the Control Center. Apply the included v3.7.0 SQL update before creating new accounts. No Client DLL replacement, media update, GameServer replacement, or ShardManager replacement is required.

## Update v3.6.9

Release date: 2026-08-14

- The Control Center now uses the SQL password stored in Windows Credential Manager when the packaged settings file intentionally contains no password, preventing false SQL Offline status after an update.
- Developer/Test publishing now preserves the operator's existing local settings instead of replacing saved connection details.
- Requirement: replace the Filter package and restart the Control Center. No SQL update, Client DLL replacement, media update, GameServer replacement, or ShardManager replacement is required.

## Update v3.6.8

Release date: 2026-08-14

- The Control Center now opens responsively without loading complete service log files during Dashboard startup.
- Service log previews read only a bounded trailing window, so opening Runtime Actions or Service Logs remains fast even when an older log is very large.
- Filter service logs now roll automatically at 32 MB and retain a bounded history, preventing a single daily log from growing to gigabytes.
- Requirement: replace the Filter package and restart the Control Center, Agent, Download, and Gateway processes. No SQL update, Client DLL replacement, media update, GameServer replacement, or ShardManager replacement is required.

## Update v3.6.7

Release date: 2026-08-14

- Clientless characters assigned to stand in town are now distributed across multiple safe areas throughout their selected city instead of reusing old clustered home coordinates.
- Town parking is recalculated for the complete active city group, keeping characters visibly separated and consistently distributed when accounts are opened or reloaded.
- Characters returning after hunting or death now finish at their assigned separated town position rather than remaining stacked on the shared resurrection point.
- The distribution applies to Jangan, Donwhang, Hotan, SamarKand, Constantinople, and Alexandria North (SD), with spacing adjusted automatically for the number of active characters.
- Requirement: replace the Filter package and restart the Agent Filter. No SQL update, Client DLL replacement, media update, Admin Desktop replacement, GameServer replacement, or ShardManager replacement is required.

## Update v3.6.6

Release date: 2026-08-14

- Clientless pet variation is now restricted to a verified set of original vSRO attack and grab pets; custom, event, fellow, and incomplete media records are never selected.
- Clientless combat refuses to summon any pet outside the verified vSRO set, preventing nearby game clients from crashing because a custom pet has missing client resources.
- **Prepare Existing Combat** now replaces previously assigned non-standard pets with stable, varied vSRO pets and removes their obsolete companion records safely.
- Pet preparation now works across servers whose Filter and Shard databases use different collations.
- Requirement: stop or disconnect the managed accounts, replace the Filter package and Admin Desktop application, restart the Agent Filter, then run **Prepare Existing Combat** once. If an old grab pet contains stored items, empty it before preparation. No separate SQL script, Client DLL replacement, media update, GameServer replacement, or ShardManager replacement is required.

## Update v3.6.5

Release date: 2026-08-14

- Corrected Saved Accounts so Quick Login remains available after saving, removing, retrying, or using another saved account on the same login screen.
- Repeated clicks are now ignored safely while the next secure request is being prepared, preventing false request-expired messages without reducing device verification.
- Requirement: replace the Filter files and restart the Gateway role. No SQL update, Client DLL replacement, media update, Admin Desktop replacement, GameServer replacement, or ShardManager replacement is required.

## Update v3.6.4

Release date: 2026-08-14

- Clientless hunters now acquire the next available monster with a short, naturally varied reaction instead of waiting through a visible idle interval after each kill.
- New managed characters receive a varied attack pet and grab pet selected from the server's active vSRO catalog, together with attack-pet health, revival, and hunger supplies.
- Clientless combat automatically summons both pets, commands the attack pet against the current monster, restores its health and hunger, revives it when required, and safely summons either pet again after it disappears.
- **Prepare Existing Combat** now adds the same varied pet pair and supplies to existing managed characters while preserving pets they already own.
- Clientless coordinate transfers now use the direct-position route, removing the misleading GameServer `unknown teleport gate: 0` message generated by a position transfer that did not use a teleport gate.
- Pet provisioning is performed as one protected inventory allocation batch, keeping large account creation and preparation runs responsive.
- Requirement: replace the Filter package, Admin Desktop application, and GameServer add-on; restart the Agent Filter and GameServer, then run **Prepare Existing Combat** once for existing managed characters that need pets. No separate SQL script, Client DLL replacement, media update, or ShardManager replacement is required.

## Update v3.6.3

Release date: 2026-08-14

- Corrected every European Clientless armor family against the server's native vSRO records: Warriors now wear heavy armor, Rogues wear light armor, and Wizard, Warlock, Bard, and Cleric characters wear robes. Both normal and C_RARE sets are supported for male and female characters.
- New Clientless characters now receive one of six complete, gender-compatible avatar sets. **Prepare Existing Combat** gives the same varied avatars to managed characters whose avatar inventory is empty while preserving any avatar deliberately assigned earlier.
- Party Matching no longer creates one isolated form per character. Online characters are grouped into real GameServer parties of up to eight by city, and only each confirmed leader publishes a Party Form linked to the real party.
- Party grouping now runs automatically after the login batch settles, while the dashboard still provides a manual rebuild action when an operator wants to regroup immediately.
- Replaced the shared hunter-count control with a clear per-city runtime plan. Operators can choose the total accounts to keep online and the number of those accounts that should hunt; the difference remains online and parked in the city, while the remainder stays offline.
- Applying a city runtime plan uses stable account ordering so the same characters keep their online, hunter, and parked roles across reloads.
- The Hunting Areas coordinate editor now uses direct text fields with save-time validation, preventing the desktop application from freezing when moving between Region, X, Y, Z, and Radius fields.
- Requirement: replace the Filter package and Admin Desktop application, restart the Agent Filter service, and run **Prepare Existing Combat** once for existing managed characters that need corrected European equipment or avatars. No separate SQL script, Client DLL replacement, media update, GameServer replacement, or ShardManager replacement is required.

## Update v3.6.2

Release date: 2026-08-14

- Corrected the European Wizard and Rogue mastery assignment to match the server's native vSRO records: Wizard Staff now uses Wizard mastery, while Crossbow and Dagger use Rogue mastery.
- European account creation no longer rolls back a complete city batch with “No valid monster attack skill” when Wizard Staff, Crossbow, or Dagger is selected.
- Existing Wizard, Crossbow, and Dagger characters can now be repaired by **Prepare Existing Combat**, which replaces the incorrect mastery and skills with the correct weapon-compatible ranks.
- Verified every supported European weapon against the configured server reference database at level 110; each class resolves one or more valid learned damage-skill branches before creation is accepted.
- Requirement: replace the Filter package and Admin Desktop application, restart the Agent Filter service, and run **Prepare Existing Combat** once for European accounts created by an earlier version. No separate SQL script, Client DLL replacement, media update, GameServer replacement, or ShardManager replacement is required.

## Update v3.6.1

Release date: 2026-08-14

- Corrected the batch equipment-repair failure that stopped on the second character with a duplicate temporary slot key; **Prepare Existing Combat** now processes complete Chinese and European account batches.
- Reworked European damage-skill discovery to follow native vSRO damage metadata even when European skill records use different target flags, restoring Wizard Staff and the other European weapon rotations while still excluding imbues, resurrection, sacrifice, and base placeholders.
- Generated and prepared Clientless characters now receive a large level-scaled STR and INT survival reserve, giving both builds genuinely high GameServer-derived maximum HP and MP instead of only raising the current values.
- Every generated character now receives a standard vSRO speed-drug stack; Clientless combat activates it automatically and schedules renewal when its normal duration expires. **Prepare Existing Combat** adds the item to older managed characters when missing.
- New characters retain their original town coordinate for later standby returns, while older accounts use a stable five-area city-wide distribution instead of appearing in one cluster.
- Creating real parties of eight now clears stale individual listings and submits one Party Form per confirmed leader using the actual GameServer party ID; the dashboard action also enables Party Form automatically when required.
- Strengthened Clientless equipment repair and verification so previously incomplete European robe, light, or heavy armor profiles are rebuilt before their combat skills are prepared.
- Requirement: replace the Filter package and Admin Desktop application, restart the Agent Filter service, and run **Prepare Existing Combat** once for existing accounts. No separate SQL script, Client DLL replacement, media update, GameServer replacement, or ShardManager replacement is required.

## Update v3.6.0

Release date: 2026-08-14

- Corrected newly generated European equipment families so Warriors receive heavy armor, Rogues receive light armor, and Wizard, Warlock, Bard, and Cleric characters receive robes that match their vSRO class.
- New Clientless characters are now rejected safely unless every selected equipment slot resolves to a live item with a valid reference, durability, race, gender, level, and inventory link; incomplete characters are no longer reported as successfully equipped.
- **Prepare Existing Combat** now rebuilds and verifies the complete visible equipment set before repairing stats, masteries, skills, shields, arrows, and bolts.
- Corrected European attack discovery so valid entity-targeted Wizard Staff and other European damage skills are not discarded because their activity metadata overlaps the value used by Chinese imbues; base placeholders remain excluded.
- Character creation and preparation now stop with a clear error if the selected weapon has no valid learned monster-attack skill, preventing silent normal-attack-only profiles.
- Added **Create Parties of 8 Now** to the Clientless dashboard. It creates real confirmed vSRO parties by city and hunting area, assigns a leader, securely accepts only managed invitations, and caps each group at eight members.
- Returning Clientless characters now receive stable separate parking positions around their selected town instead of appearing on exactly the same coordinates.
- Requirement: replace the Filter package and Admin Desktop application, restart the Agent Filter service, and run **Prepare Existing Combat** once for previously created Clientless characters. No separate SQL script, Client DLL replacement, media update, GameServer replacement, or ShardManager replacement is required.

## Update v3.5.2

Release date: 2026-08-13

- Corrected false required-client-update disconnects that could occur when login started before device verification was delivered and completed.
- Repeated server-list and character-selection updates no longer replace an active device-verification request.
- Requirement: replace the Filter files and restart the Gateway and Agent roles. No SQL update, Client DLL replacement, media update, Admin Desktop replacement, GameServer replacement, or ShardManager replacement is required.

## Update v3.5.1

Release date: 2026-08-13

- Corrected false required-client-update disconnects on Windows Server, VPS, and player PCs when local device verification could not finish its first initialization.
- Multiple game clients opened under the same Windows account now initialize device verification consistently without interfering with each other.
- Requirement: replace the Client DLL and fully restart all game clients. No Filter restart, SQL update, media update, Admin Desktop replacement, GameServer replacement, or ShardManager replacement is required.

## Update v3.5.0

Release date: 2026-08-13

- Rebuilt Clientless world-loading and movement tracking around the complete vSRO character-data, teleport, position, and speed lifecycle, preventing repeated transfers, invisible characters, false arrivals, and synchronized reconnect loops.
- Corrected learned-skill selection for every supported Chinese and European weapon, including Wizard Staff and Warlock Rod, while separating real monster attacks, Chinese imbues, self buffs, and incompatible utility skills.
- Improved combat behavior with confirmed self buffs, independent emergency HP and MP recovery, ranged stopping distance, stable target movement, and normal-attack fallback only when no compatible learned attack is usable.
- Corrected generated and prepared characters so STR, INT, current HP, current MP, account ownership, mastery limits, and obsolete mastery skills remain consistent with the selected level and weapon profile.
- Added a customer-friendly hunter allocation per city: all enabled accounts may stay online while only the requested number hunts, and one button stops hunting and returns the selected cities to standby without disconnecting them.
- Replaced the Hunting Areas coordinate grid with a direct five-row editor so moving between Region, X, Y, Z, and Radius no longer freezes the Dashboard; incomplete values are validated only when saving.

- Clientless characters now prepare real compatible self buffs before combat, send self-target buffs with the correct character target, and choose one compatible Chinese imbue without repeatedly replacing it.
- Improved combat rotation to respect each skill's range and full action duration, immediately continue to another learned skill after a rejection, and reserve normal attacks for periods when no learned damage skill is ready.
- Removed hunting-area teleports from routine movement and target timeout recovery, preventing characters from repeatedly disappearing and reappearing while they hunt.
- Added explicit confirmed-death diagnostics so a real death and town recovery can be distinguished from movement recovery in Filter logs.

- Corrected Full STR and Full INT allocation from the vSRO base value and added one-click repair for previously created Clientless characters.
- Corrected arrows and bolts so ranged characters equip their ammunition in the required secondary equipment slot, with automatic repair for existing accounts.
- Improved real combat behavior with weapon-matched skill rotation, casting-time-aware responses, MP use only when required, closer melee approach, and removal of conditional down-attack skills from normal rotation.

- Auto Potion now checks existing abnormal states immediately and stops all related background activity when disabled.
- Character and pet potion handling is more reliable across simultaneous health, mana, vigor, pill, speed, summon, and resurrection conditions.
- Auto Hunt now restores its saved state, evaluates HP and MP potion totals correctly, and safely stops when a requested town return cannot be completed.
- Patrol movement, target range calculations, party invitations, party buffs, and party resurrection now select valid nearby targets consistently.
- Auto Skill now handles invalid or outdated skill entries safely and supports weapon-independent skills without requiring a configured weapon slot.
- Auto Scroll now validates the live inventory item, effect, and slot before use and prevents repeated invalid use attempts.
- Pet Filter now respects cross-region distance, filters items consistently for character and pet pickup, limits pickup requests, and releases old pickup history.
- Prevented several macro-related crashes during window cleanup, scene changes, missing item data, oversized skill lists, and invalid saved slots.

### Improvements
- Macro setting files are created reliably when the local settings folder is missing.
- Saved Auto Hunt choices and party lists are reflected correctly in the configuration window.

### Update Requirements
- Replace the client DLL and restart the game client.

- Fixed simultaneous client launches intermittently leaving all but one client unable to select the server.

## Update v1.2.0
**Release Date:** 2026-07-27

### New Features
- Added centrally managed server slots so one customer license can authorize multiple Game Servers on separate public IP addresses.
- Added a shared online-player limit across all active licensed servers.
- Added independent license enforcement for the Filter, GameServer add-on, ShardManager add-on, and client DLL package.

### Improvements
- The License Center now accepts one IPv4 address per server slot and supports common one-, two-, three-, four-, five-, and eight-server plans.
- Selecting the number of Game Servers now creates a separate, clearly labeled IP field for every server.
- Customer packages now carry a signed customer binding in the client and server add-ons.
- Short-lived leases are protected against being copied to another Windows server while remaining automatically renewable from a licensed IP.

### Security
- Unlisted server IPs, excess active server slots, copied leases, modified package bindings, and combined player totals above the licensed limit are rejected.
- Suspended licenses and server-IP changes clear active server heartbeats immediately.

### Update Requirements
- Restart the License Server after installing this update.
- Generate and deliver a new customer package, then replace the Filter, GameServer add-on, ShardManager add-on, and client DLL files.
- Start the Filter once on each licensed server before starting GameServer or ShardManager.
- For multi-server customers, set each server's Filter `ServerIP` value to that server's own licensed public IP.

- Removed obsolete reward states automatically when their reward definition is removed.

- Players now receive a clear response when attendance was already recorded or when a reward is unavailable.

### Security

- Malformed and excessively repeated Attendance requests are rejected safely.

### Update Requirements
- Stop all KMTGuard Agent instances before applying the included Attendance database update.
- Replace both the KMTGuard filter files and the client DLL, then restart the Agent service.
- Run the included Attendance validation after the database update.
- This update does not add Attendance rewards; reward configuration remains under the server administrator's control.
